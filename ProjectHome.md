**Stock Droid** is the ultimate tool for managing your portfolios, watch stocks as they change and analyse them, all within one Android cellphone.

---


# Data #
With Stock Droid you get the financial data from multiple sources, with a simple interface - either Google Finance or Yahoo! Finance, as well as many others. If you are familiar with Java, you can add new sources easily.

# Technical analysis #
Technical analysis in your pocket? Stock Droid can handle that. Drawing trends, moving averages, MACD, candlesticks... anything that a real-life stock broker uses, now is in your reach.

# Stock Alarm #
We don't expect you stare at the screen of your mobile all the time, just to keep up with the prices. Why don't you just set an action when the stock's price reaches the limit - send a message to your stock broker or just start up an alarm?

# Portfolios #
Either from your financial site, or in the mobile, Stock Droid takes care of analysing your portfolio, or even finding the one that suits your needs.

The project has been written in the Java language for the Android platform. Hesitate no more if you want to contribute!
